WT Map+
=======

WT Map+ is a Chrome extension that enhances the browser-based
map in [War Thunder](http://warthunder.com/). It is meant to be used
in multi-monitor setups.

Features
--------

New:

 * Different plane icons for fighters, bombers and attackers
 * Plane icons show plane orientation
 * Proximity alert that plays a sound when the number of nearby enemies increases
 * Configurable options:
   * Proximity alert radius and volume 
   * Plane icon size
 * Title bar info:
   * Number of enemies within proximity radius
   * The distance to the closest enemy
   * The total number of allied planes

Planned:

 * Player view centering
 * Configurable tone for proximity alert

Usage
-----

Install the app from the Chrome Web Store and open it from the Apps menu.

Notes
-----

The app currently doesn't support running on a different machine 
than the game (i.e., the default map should be available at 
[http://localhost:8111](http://localhost:8111).

The features added by this app don't depend on any Chrome specific
functionality, and they were implemented in a Chrome app  just for 
development convenience.

The idea of making this app comes from the
[War Thunder tactical map](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.junkcode.warthundertacticalmap)
Android app.
